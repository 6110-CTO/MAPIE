class EnsembleEstimator(RegressorMixin):
    """
    This class implements methods to handle the training and usage of the
    estimator. This estimator can be unique or composed by cross validated
    estimators.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator: Optional[RegressorMixin]
        Any regressor with scikit-learn API
        (i.e. with ``fit`` and ``predict`` methods).
        If ``None``, estimator defaults to a ``LinearRegression`` instance.

        By default ``None``.

    method: str
        Method to choose for prediction interval estimates.
        Choose among:

        - ``"naive"``, based on training set conformity scores,
        - ``"base"``, based on validation sets conformity scores,
        - ``"plus"``, based on validation conformity scores and
          testing predictions,
        - ``"minmax"``, based on validation conformity scores and
          testing predictions (min/max among cross-validation clones).

        By default ``"plus"``.

    cv: Optional[Union[int, str, BaseCrossValidator]]
        The cross-validation strategy for computing conformity scores.
        It directly drives the distinction between jackknife and cv variants.
        Choose among:

        - ``None``, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
          If equal to ``-1``, equivalent to
          ``sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut()``.
        - CV splitter: any ``sklearn.model_selection.BaseCrossValidator``
          Main variants are:
            - ``sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut`` (jackknife),
            - ``sklearn.model_selection.KFold`` (cross-validation),
            - ``subsample.Subsample`` object (bootstrap).
        - ``"split"``, does not involve cross-validation but a division
          of the data into training and calibration subsets. The splitter
          used is the following: ``sklearn.model_selection.ShuffleSplit``.
        - ``"prefit"``, assumes that ``estimator`` has been fitted already,
          and the ``method`` parameter is ignored.
          All data provided in the ``fit`` method is then used
          for computing conformity scores only.
          At prediction time, quantiles of these conformity scores are used
          to provide a prediction interval with fixed width.
          The user has to take care manually that data for model fitting and
          conformity scores estimate are disjoint.

        By default ``None``.

    test_size: Optional[Union[int, float]]
        If ``float``, should be between ``0.0`` and ``1.0`` and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. If ``int``,
        represents the absolute number of test samples. If ``None``,
        it will be set to ``0.1``.

        If cv is not ``"split"``, ``test_size`` is ignored.

        By default ``None``.

    n_jobs: Optional[int]
        Number of jobs for parallel processing using joblib
        via the "locky" backend.
        If ``-1`` all CPUs are used.
        If ``1`` is given, no parallel computing code is used at all,
        which is useful for debugging.
        For ``n_jobs`` below ``-1``, ``(n_cpus + 1 - n_jobs)`` are used.
        ``None`` is a marker for `unset` that will be interpreted as
        ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution).

        By default ``None``.

    agg_function: Optional[str]
        Determines how to aggregate predictions from perturbed models, both at
        training and prediction time.

        If ``None``, it is ignored except if ``cv`` class is ``Subsample``,
        in which case an error is raised.
        If ``"mean"`` or ``"median"``, returns the mean or median of the
        predictions computed from the out-of-folds models.
        Note: if you plan to set the ``ensemble`` argument to ``True`` in the
        ``predict`` method, you have to specify an aggregation function.
        Otherwise an error would be raised.

        The Jackknife+ interval can be interpreted as an interval around the
        median prediction, and is guaranteed to lie inside the interval,
        unlike the single estimator predictions.

        When the cross-validation strategy is ``Subsample`` (i.e. for the
        Jackknife+-after-Bootstrap method), this function is also used to
        aggregate the training set in-sample predictions.

        If ``cv`` is ``"prefit"`` or ``"split"``, ``agg_function`` is ignored.

        By default ``"mean"``.

    verbose: int
        The verbosity level, used with joblib for multiprocessing.
        The frequency of the messages increases with the verbosity level.
        If it more than ``10``, all iterations are reported.
        Above ``50``, the output is sent to stdout.

        By default ``0``.

    random_state: Optional[Union[int, RandomState]]
        Pseudo random number generator state used for random sampling.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

        By default ``None``.

        Estimator fitted on the whole training set.

        List of out-of-folds estimators.
